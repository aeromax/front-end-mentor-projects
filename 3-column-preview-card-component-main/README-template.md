## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've gotten much more efficient at using flexbox, as well as labeling my CSS more semantically and simply. One new thing I accomplished with this project was avoiding use of inner wrappers inside each element, instead choosing to use padding to add space around the content.
