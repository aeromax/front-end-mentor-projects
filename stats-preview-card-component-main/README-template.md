## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I made a more concerted effort this time to write simpler CSS and to think better about the structure before I started. In addition, I declared my flex arrangements into seperate classes, so I had less to fiddle with in my styles. This definetly took less time to produce than the first two projects I created.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
