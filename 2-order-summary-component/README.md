## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I started this challenge basically the same way I started the first one, which was to organize the content into it's various groups and containers before styling anything. I was able to improve my flexbox skills some more with this challenge.

### Continued development

 I ended up making a lot of structure changes to the code as I worked. While I didn't learn many new things in terms of CSS or HTML, I do need to learn a better approach to starting a project so that my HTML and CSS structure is better thought out, and done in a way that keeps me organized. I feel that I started getting sloppier as I went along, patching in band-aid fixes to various issues and solutions.
