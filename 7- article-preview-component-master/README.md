## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was the first project I took on where the desktop and mobile presentation of a particular feature was very different from eachother. I found myself going back and forth between the desktop and mobile styles over and over again, and rebuilding parts of the share-toggle because of the complicated positioning and display variations I had to figure out.
