### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

With this project, I decided to practice my use of using flexbox in my CSS. This proved to be a great way to space things out and get them aligned quickly. Although I know a bit of SASS, I decided to start learning about CSS variables instead, as this was a small project which I felt didn't require the use of a large amount of pre-processing.

### Continued development

In the future, I want to learn a cleaner way to write more semantic CSS classes.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-tricks.com FlexBox cheat sheet](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I found this great cheat sheet for flexbox which helped me figure out which flexbox options I needed, and how to apply them.
