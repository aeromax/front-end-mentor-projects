## My process

For this project, I decided to tackle the desktop view first since it was somewhat of a complex layout that involved using CSS grid. I found it much easier to deconstruct the desktop version for a simple stacked mobile view, rather than the other way around.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I decided to use this project to learn the basics of CSS grid. I was able to create a simple grid of columns and rows, and place elements within their respective row/column spans easily.
